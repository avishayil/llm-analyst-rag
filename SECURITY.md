# Security

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in this project.

## Security Features

- **User Pool Integration**: The project uses AWS Cognito for secure user authentication. Cognito provides a robust, scalable authentication solution that handles sign-up, sign-in, and access control.

- **Token-Based Authentication**: Access to the FastAPI endpoints is secured using JWT tokens generated by AWS Cognito. This ensures that only authenticated users can access protected resources.

- **Gradio Integration**: The Gradio interface is also secured using AWS Cognito, allowing users to authenticate before interacting with the application.

- **Protected Routes**: LLM interface API endpoints, which has the potential to be the most expensive, are protected by authentication (JWT validation), rate limit and strict length for user provided data. This ensures that only authorized users can perform interactions with the LLM, with strict limitations.

- **HTTPS Enforcement**: All data in transit between the client, FastAPI server, AWS Bedrock, and AWS Cognito is encrypted using HTTPS. This protects against man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. This obviously does not apply to development applications, accessible on localhost.

- **Signed Tokens**: JWT tokens issued by AWS Cognito are signed and verified by the application by querying the cognito JWKS endpoint, ensuring the integrity of authentication data.

- **Strict Input Validation**: The project employs strict input validation for all user inputs, especially for authentication and API requests, reducing the risk of injection attacks.

- **Sanitization**: User inputs are sanitized to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) and other injection-based attacks.

- **Token Limit**: User is limited to specific amount of tokens to prevent Denial of Wallet attacks on the LLM cost, and when it exceeds the quota, further requests will fail.

- **Poetry for Dependency Management**: Dependencies are managed using Poetry, which provides a lock file (`poetry.lock`) to ensure the integrity and security of the package versions used.
